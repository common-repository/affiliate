The Affiliate plugin is a toolbox for Affiliate Marketers.

== Description ==

The Affiliate plugin is a toolbox for Affiliate Marketers.

It provides a set of tools that affiliate marketers can use to include marketing resources on their site.

**Automatically Link Keywords**

If you want to be able to have your affiliate links placed automatically on your site by keyword, then this could be the right tool for you.

**Current Features**

- Keyword Linker : Its purpose is to define keywords that are substituted automatically with your affiliate links, anywhere they appear in the content of your site.

  For example, you can define a keyword 'dog food' and have it substituted by a link to https://www.example.com/?affiliates=123 anywhere it appears in your site's content.

  Supports full word and partial word matches, allows replacements to be made also in languages that do not separate words with spaces.

Additional features that we might add in the future if there is interest (please let us know if you're interested or have other suggestions):

- Affiliate Link Index
- Link Converter
- Link Stats

Please note that this plugin is different from the [Affiliates](https://wordpress.org/plugins/affiliates/) plugin,
*that* one allows to run an affiliate program on a site while *this* here doesn't.
